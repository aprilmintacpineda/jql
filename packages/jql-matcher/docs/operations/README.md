# List of operations

The following are the built-in operations that you can use out of the box. Generally speaking, the structure is as follows:

```js
{
  field: {
    $operation: expectedValue
  }
}
```

- `field` is the field you want to check.
- `$operation` is the operations's name.
- `expectedValue` is the value you want to expect to be in the filtered result. Each operation expects different value such as `Array`, `Number`, `String`. Some operations accept `undefined` and `null`.
