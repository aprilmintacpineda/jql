## $between

`$between` does `min < field && max > field`. It accepts an `Array` of `[min, max]` where `min` and `max` are `Number`s.

```js
{
  field: {
    $between: [17, 25]
  }
}
```

## $iBetween

`$between` does `min <= field && max >= field`. It accepts an `Array` of `[min, max]` where `min` and `max` are `Number`s.

```js
{
  field: {
    $between: [17, 25]
  }
}
```

## $notBetween

`$between` does `!(min <= field && max >= field)`. It accepts an `Array` of `[min, max]` where `min` and `max` are `Number`s.

```js
{
  field: {
    $between: [17, 25]
  }
}
```

## $iNotBetween

`$between` does `!(min <= field && max >= field)`. It accepts an `Array` of `[min, max]` where `min` and `max` are `Number`s.

```js

    $between: [17, 25]
